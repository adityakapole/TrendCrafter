## 🛠️ Workflow
### 🤖 Agents
#### Senior Researcher (news_researcher):
Role: Uncover groundbreaking technologies in a specified topic. <br>
Goal: To explore, analyze, and report on the latest technological trends.<br>
Backstory: Driven by curiosity, this agent is at the forefront of innovation, eager to share knowledge that could change the world.<br>

#### Writer (news_writer):
Role: Craft compelling narratives about the technological trends identified by the researcher.<br>
Goal: To present complex topics in an engaging and accessible manner, making new discoveries understandable to a wider audience.<br>
Backstory: With a flair for simplifying complex topics, this agent is dedicated to educating and captivating readers with tech stories.<br><br>

### 📝 Tasks
#### Research Task:
Description: Identify the next big trend in a specified topic. The task focuses on the pros and cons of the trend, its market opportunities, and potential risks.<br>
Expected Output: A comprehensive 3-paragraph report on the latest AI trends.<br>
#### Writing Task:
Description: Compose an insightful article on the identified trend, highlighting how it is impacting the industry.<br>
Expected Output: A 4-paragraph article formatted as markdown, ready for publishing as a blog post.<br>

### 🔄 Process
The agents collaborate in a sequential process, where the researcher first identifies the trend, and the writer then crafts the article. The process is designed to ensure a coherent and efficient workflow, producing high-quality content.
